		<p><font size="6" font color="white"><b>League of Legends</b>, <i>As in other multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games, each player in League of Legends controls a character ("champion") with a set of unique abilities. Most games involve two teams of five players, with each player using a different champion.The two teams compete to be the first to destroy the Nexus structure within the opposing base.</p>
		<p>Over the course of each game, champions become stronger and gain additional abilities by earning experience and thereby levelling up. Experience is earned by killing enemies (or being nearby when a teammate does). Champions also build strength over the course of the game by buying progressively more powerful items using gold, which is earned by killing non-player enemies, killing or assisting in killing enemy players, destroying enemy structures, or selling other items.</i></p>
		<p>This game is more in tactics and cool gameplay and i play also mobile legends but im so focused at pc games this game is more in cosmetics and animations thats why i like this game.</p>
		<p><font size="7" font color="yellow">ACHIVEMENTS</font></p>
		<p>I play this game in year 2014 to 2017 and the impact of this game for me is the instinct of being a player to dodge some skills etc. Because game i met some friends in online and i enjoy the game even im derank situation its fine but really stressy and so hard to grind a rank you need to be a deccent player or not chocking or tilted in the game to have a better performance. Here i will show the rank system and what is my higher rank that i achive and many more.</p>
